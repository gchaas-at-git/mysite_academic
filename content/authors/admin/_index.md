My skills can be described as a combination of survey methodology, UX research and data science. As a **survey methodologist**, I have broad knowledge in designing and conducting complex surveys and research apps. As a **UX researcher**, I focus on designing user friendly products to minimize burden and maximize transparency of the data collection process. As a **data scientist**, I am able to generate valuable insights by analyzing and combining various data sources. 

Combining these skills, I plan, manage and conduct challenging and innovative data collection [projects](#100_projects) as well as helping researchers design their data collections. 

I recently finished my doctorate and am about to decide in which direction my professional future should develop and which projects to tackle next.
