title: IAB-HOPP 
subtitle: A high frequency online data collection during COVID-19 (2020/2021)

summary: To assess the the changes in people’s life and work situations during the May 2020 to March 2021, the High-frequency Online Personal Panel (IAB-HOPP) surveyed individuals from in seven waves. The data was used to evaluate the effect of corona on different dimensions in the labour market, such as, employment trends, short-time work, social and financial security, working hours, home office, and child care. The [HOPP data is available at the Research Data Center](https://fdz.iab.de/en/FDZ_Individual_Data/HOPP/HOPP-ADIAB7519v1.aspx) of the Insitute for Employment Research. Combined with the administrative data at the IAB, HOPP data provide long-term research opportunities of COVID-19 pandemic.

**Description:** 
During the first year of the COVID-19 crisis, policymakers required timely data and research results that allowed for
informed decisions. The HOPP project was conducted to meet this demand and to enable researchers to evaluate vast consequences of the corona crisis and the associated lockdown policies for public health, social life, and the economy. Overall, seven waves from May 2020 to March 2021 were conducted. 

To assess individual dynamics the HOPP collected data on a monthly (wave one to four) and bi-monthly (wave five to seven) basis. Furthermore, respondents were divided into four groups. The diferent groups of a new wave were invited to
the survey at weekly intervals (wave two to four) or bi-weekly intervals (wave fve to seven). This gives us the advantage of being able to provide weekly data while each participant only had to participate on a monthly or bi-monthly basis. For more detail on the study design see [Haas et al. 2021](../../publication/2021_hopp).

The questionnaire modules were developed primarily by the team at the Institute for Employment Research and in cooperation with external researchers. The HOPP study addresses several labour market related topics, such as, employment trends, short-time work, social and financial security, working hours, home office, and child care. 

The HOPP study is based on a probability sample of individuals drawn from the administrative data of the Federal Employment Agency in Germany, containing information on all labour market participants except civil servants and self-employed. This procedure enables researchers to conduct analyses that respresent the German labor market. 

Next to the timely assessment of changes during the early years of the corona crisis, the HOPP data will be used by researchers to evaluate the long-term effects of corona based on the people’s social life and working situation during corona.
