abstract: Since the Corona virus SARS-CoV-2 started spreading, life in Germany has changed. Many people have to cope with new situations such as home office or child care at home, may be affected by short-timework or have lost their jobs. Governments at the federal and state level are trying to cope with this situation with a wide variety of measures – such as exit restrictions or mandatory masks. But how do the virus and the measures affect people's social and working lives? The IAB has set up a new survey, the High-frequency Online Personal Panel "Life and Work Situations in Times of Corona" (IAB-HOPP), which asked people about their current living and working situation every month from May 2020 to March 2021. The data will allow researchers to explore the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. This data report provides an overview of the prepared data.
