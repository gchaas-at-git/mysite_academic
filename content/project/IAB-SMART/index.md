title: IAB-SMART
subtitle: Collecting Data for Labor Market Research Through a Smartphone App (2017-present) 
summary: The IAB-SMART study an Android smartphone app data collection project that collected survey data and digital trace data, such as, geolocations, telephone and text message logs, characteristics of social networks from smartphone contacts, mobility data and smartphone usage data. The data is used to explore different challenges when collecting smartphone data, such as recruitment challenges, coverage, nonresponse and measurement error etc.

**Description:** 
The IAB-SMART study explores the feasibility of combining passively collected smartphone and survey data to replicate old and gain new insights into labor market research. To achieve this purpose, we invited 4,293 individuals to install the the IAB-SMART app for six months in 2018. The collected data includes a wide range of digital trace data, such as, geolocations, telephone and text message logs, characteristics of social networks from smartphone contacts, mobility data and smartphone usage data.

Most studies using smartphone data to answer their research questions are based on convenience samples, have a small sample size (less than 100 participants), have a short data collection period (less than a month) and/or are limited in evaluating potential sources of error in their data. The IAB-SMART study overcame these limitations by selecting and inviting participants from the already existing panel study "Labour Market and Social Security" (PASS) ([Trappmann et al. 2019](https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/48/5/1411/5457633)). PASS is a household survey of the general population in Germany with annual waves of data collection. The focus of PASS is on unemployment, poverty and recipiency of state transfers. Using PASS as a starting point to invite study participants has the benefit that a relationship of trust between study participants and the IAB is already implemented.

The IAB-SMART study is a good example on how to explore new opportunities and challenges to design new data collection approaches and integrate combined survey and organic data while assessing different sources of errors along the themes of the total survey error framework (TSE). For instance, linking PASS and IAB-SMART data provides background information about participants and nonparticipants, making it possible to assess coverage and nonresponse bias in the IAB-SMART participant sample (see [Keusch et al. 2020](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0049124120914924), [Keusch et al. 2022](https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/rssa.12827)).
